                                    <p class="mb-4">Since I have Windows 10 on my laptop, the set up was fairly straightforward. I created a virtual environment for FastRobots_ble which created a directory for the same. Following this, I installed some packages for the tasks and unzipped the codebase in the directory we created. Now I’m set to code in Python on the virtual environment. I then installed AruinoBLE from the library manager in IDE and generated MAC address using a sample code called ble_arduino to extract the device MAC Address. For this, the serial baud rate was set at 115200. </p>

This process generates a timestamp value in each iteration of the loop and sends it over. Second method: store timestamp values in an array of size 1000 at once and then send those values to my computer via bluetooth. In the first method, the while loop runs for 5 seconds and produces 73 values of timestamp in double data type. This gives a frequency of 14.6Hz (record 14.6 values per second). In the second method, we changed the array size and it stores 500 values of double timestamp and the time taken is 0.011 seconds. This gives a frequency of 45KHz (45,000 values recorded per second). This goes on to show that the array method of recording values in substantially faster than the looping method. The Artemis has 384KB of RAM.

                                    <p class="mb-4">Test: We sent data as multiples of character 'a' which is 1 byte. We sent and received data in multiples of 5 with an interval of 5 starting from 5 to 120. We recorded the time taken for the data to be sent and received and evaluated the data rate for each data that we sent. Overhead is a combination of excess computation time, and here we see that as the number of bytes being sent increases, the data rate also increases. At 5 bytes sent, the data rate is 17.94 bytes/second whereas at 120 bytes sent, the data rate is 248.97 bytes/second. This means that the overhead problem tends to reduce with increasing replies size. However, we noticed dips at 65, 75, 105, 110, 115, and 120 bytes being sent. This shows that as the data size becomes too big (i.e > 100 bytes), the data rate takes a dip and reduces. </p>

For this, we saw that the AD0_VAL was set 1 which is the last bit of the I2C address. However the value becomes 0 when ADR jumper is closed. Therefore, to maintain correct address, we changed it to 0 which correctly initialized the sensor.</p>

However, the values generated from the complementary filter absorbs the noise and is close to the trend of the values from accelerometer. This shows that the complementary filter indeed reduces noise and adjusts for any bias that we otherwise see in the values from the gyroscope.</p>

We simply create an array with values from the accelerometer stored in them and see if the values change or not. The hypothesis is that if the values change, it means the IMU updates its values faster than the main loop of the Artemis. The result below shows that the values generated by IMU are indeed different at each index of the array, thus proving that the IMU works faster than the Artemis. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">One big array to store data can be beneficial since it creates simplicity if multiple variables are being tracaked. Moreover, the indexing and the retrieval of values using array indexing becomes easier and convenient. Moreover, one single variable that stores an array takes up less space in the memory compared to multiple variables of arrays. However, separate arrays in my experience creates a cleaner code with everything well defined and separated. I believe that in Robotics, there’s a need to boost sampling rate to acquire real time values from the sensors and also maximize the number of samples that can be stored without leading to an overflow to provide feedback to the robot for longer time. For this purpose, I believe one single array would be useful.  </p>

Although integer takes 4 bytes which is lesser than float or double and string takes up 2 bytes per character, they don’t serve the purpose here and if numbers with more decimal places are stored, integer will ignore them whereas strings will add up to the storage taken. Therefore, float is the right data type to store data in particularly in the context of storing sensor data because it gives the right level of precision (upto 6 or 7 d.p) and takes up 4 bytes for a wide range of values. This can be argued for different applications. </p>

If we have a sample frequency of 295Hz as we saw above and each value stored is a double data type of 8 bytes each, we can store 49,152 data samples. The time it would take will be the number of data elements divided by sampling rate which is 49,152/295 = 166 seconds before the Artemis runs out of memory. </p>

Although it doesn’t have sensors and Artemis attached to it but the car was tested by steering in both directions, varying the speed, and also spinning upside down. The remote-control interfacing with the Robot Car needs some practice. Nevertheless, I’ve practiced thoroughly on how to move the robot as per our requirement in different axes. I observed that the initial torque is very high and the braking is pretty weak. The steering and spinning works well. </p>

We will focus on assessing the reliability and accuracy of the two ToF sensors and also ensure simultaneous operation of the two sensors using I2C communication protocol and Qwiic breakout board.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">For future operations on the robot, we will use two ToF sensors gone by the code VL53L1X. The two sensors have the same address hard coded on the board (0x52). Therefore, to establish I2C communication via the SDA and SCL communication lines, we need to program an shutdown routine for one of the sensors and change the address of the other sensor. This will allow us to read the measurements from both sensors.  </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">The placement of these sensors is very important considering the movement of the robot. The primary use of these sensors is obstacle avoidance. Now although it Is completely dependent on the map or path that we’re given to move the robot in, but one sensor has to be placed at the front of the robot. This will ensure that forward collision is avoided to protect from potential damage. The other sensor can be placed at the rear of the robot but we’ll have to consider the length of cables and placement of hardware which may limit the positioning of the second sensor. I believe, that placing the other sensor on the side of the robot (left side). This will give a better understanding of the surroundings. Moreover, if the sensors are placed at the front and back, they will not be of much utility since they both will assess objects in the same axes so it won’t tell much about the surroudings.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The pins from the ToF sensors that are connected to power up and send data to the Artemis should be permanently soldered so that the data transmission is established at all times. However, the GPIO pin that shuts down the ToF sensor to allow I2C communication does not have to be permanently soldered since the pin may be required in the future for some other purpose. Moreover, the battery wires are soldered to the JST connector since the primary purpose of the battery is to power up the Artemis and the robot. However, I initially considered the charging aspect of the battery but the Professor explained that when the Artemis is connected to the laptop, it automatically charges the battery. Therefore, only the connections that have to serve a single purpose throughout the course were soldered. The others were kept detachable.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">We now test if the sensor has successfully connected to Artemis and what address is allocated to the sensor. For this, we executed and uploaded an example code from Apollo3 examples; Example1_wire_I2C. The address as mentioned in the datasheet of the sensor should be (0x52). But the address that was output on the Serial monitor was (0x29). The two addresses have the same 7 bits except the last bit which is the read/write bit and since there isn’t read in the address, the address is (0x29) instead of (0x52). This code ignores the read/write bit to form the address hence outputs a different address.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The Short Range mode has a higher accuracy since shorter range. Moreover, the response time is faster since the measurement range is shorter hence fast response. However, the limited range makes it applicable only in cases where the robotic movement is confined in a small space. The medium range has a little compromised accuracy compared to short range. However, it has considerably more range which is more than twice as that of Short range. I believe Medium Range would be more applicable in our domain. Long range has 4m range which means that the accuracy reduces further but not much compared to Medium range. However, the range is one-third more compared to Medium range. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Looking at the maze and maps used in previous year’s lab, I noticed that the sensor should be able to measure distances that are considerable given the size of a standard room. A standard room has a width of about 7.6m. Keeping this in mind, the Long range would be suitable as it measures with a range of 4m compared to 1.3m and 3m from the ShortRange and MediumRange modes. However, one downside of using this mode would be the slower response time and accuracy compared to short and medium range. However, the accuracy and response rate is not as considerable as the range factor of the LongRange hence we select the Long range mode. </p>

Out of 2000 iterations of the loop, sensor 1 is data ready for 71 times whereas sensor 2 is data ready for 82 times. This tells us that the speed of Artemis is much faster than the sensor. The loop runs for 2000 times in a total time of 18 seconds in which less than 100 values from the sensors are retrieved. The time between each loop is around 9ms. The current limiting factor is the condition check if the sensors are DataReady or not and the Serial.print commands. The Artemis is way faster than the sensor’s ability to send Data.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Generally, Infrared Transmission based sensors are present both as active and passive sensors. Active sensors include ToF sensors and IR proximity sensors. These emit infrared light and record the time taken to receive the reflected light off the object/obstacle. This is how it calculates the distance from an object. These sensors produces precise measurements of distance since they emit the infrared light which is received back. It is used for obstacle avoidance, object detection, and distance measurement. But the problem related to active sensors like ToF is that they consume more power to emit light continuously which is why they tend to be more expensive due to required components. </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">Passive sensors simply rely on detecting infrared radiation emitted or reflected by the present objects. Their pro is the less requirement of power since they are not emitting light and hence have a lower cost due to simpler design. The problem with such sensors is that they are not able to provide precise distance measurements and may not provide direct distance measurements at all. They are also more vulnerable to environmental factors like temperature changes or ambient infrared radiation sources.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">I fixed our TOF sensor and placed white and black object at the same distance from the sensor. I observed that the distance measurement in both the cases do not vary a lot. The minute variation is primarily because of the noise and environmental effects. Other than that, the sensor measures the same distance for both white and black objects. From the experiment we see that color or texture does not really impact the measured distance. This can be because ToF sensors emit infrared light pulses which is not susceptible to colors compared to visible light. Hence, they are less likely effected by changes in colors or textures. However, if any object with extreme reflective or absorbent surfaces are placed, then there may be a small deviation. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">This lab extends our learning to usage of Motor Drivers by virtue of Pulse Width modulation to rotate the motor at the desired and variable speed. For this course, we use 2 dual motor drivers DRV8833 Motor driver carrier. The tasks in this lab aim to drive the two motors simultaneously in the desired direction and speed. In this lab, we simply explore open loop control system with the input signal from the Artemis.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The motors require high amount current to generate sufficient torque to drive them on different terrains. For this, we ensure that we supply output to the motor from both the output channels on the motor driver. The motor driver consists of two channels which means two motors can be operated using one motor driver but to maximize the amount of current delivered to the motor we connect each motor to both channels of the driver. For this, we connect the Input pin A1 to B1 and A2 to B2 by soldering the wires accordingly as shown in the schematic below. The actual circuit images do not clearly show the connections, hence the schematic. We used the two channels on the same motor driver since the problem with alternative approach of using two channels from two separate drivers is the possible difference in signal generation of the two drivers. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Therefore, we hook each motor to each separate motor driver interconnecting the corresponding outut and input pins. The output pins A1 was connected to B1 and A2 connected to B2</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">To generate PWM signal, we use Artemis pins 12 and 13 to power one motor and A2 and A3 to power the other motor. For this, we first confirmed that the PWM enabled pins were being used by looking at the datasheet. These pins were primarily used because ToF shutdown pin was connected to pin 8 and I wanted to keep the other connections at a distance from that and from the other motor’s connections hence the selection just to avoid any short circuiting or undesired connections established.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">We powered the Artemis and Motor driver (motors) with different batteries. The reason for this is that when the motors rotate, they may generate noise or spikes of voltage because the Motors we have are DC motors. These spikes can potentially damage the Artemis if it is connected to the same source. Also, to generate maximum power to the motors, we connect it to an entirely separate battery. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">I selected the color codes to maintain consistency between different motors and different types of connections. For inputs I used green and yellow cables and for output I used separate colors for both the motors. The wire lengths but kept long enough so that any re connections are possible and not too cumbersome. However, they were not kept so long that it may increase the vulnerability of noise. Once the wires were soldered I checked the connections by twisting and turning the cables a bit. Solid-core cables were not used since they are more sensitive to vibration at high frequency when we operate the robot car at a higher speed. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">I first unscrewed the robot’s shell and unhooked the microcontroller already installed and stripped the motor connection to be hooked to the motor driver. I removed the LED, button, and PCB as well.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">I first tested one motor by making all the connections. I connected pin A2 and A3 to the input pins of the motor driver. Then the VIN and GND were hooked to a cable that will later be connected to the battery using the connecter given at the bottom of the robot. For now, these wires were connected to a DC power supply that maintained its voltage level at 3.7V for the purpose of testing. I established the Ground between motor driver and Artemis and then ensured to connect corresponding input pins of both channels to one another (A1 to B1 and A2 to B2) and similarly for the output pins. I then connected the motor to A1 and B2 because I wanted to maintain a distance between the two soldered motor wires in order to avoid any short circuiting when the circuits were placed on the robot. </p>

However, at a PWM of 50 it started moving but on surface with friction (my room wooden floor) it didn’t move but on the tiles of the lab it moved slowly. Therefore, I set the minimum PWM at 50 at which it starts moving forward (in a straight line). </p>

The routine in the code makes the robot drive forward for 2 seconds then stop and steer to the right on its axes such that it steers 180 degree at a PWM of 200 and 230. This is the stunt we performed to confirm that robot is responding correctly.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The Artemis default frequency for analogWrite is around 980Hz. The frequency of PWM signal indicates how fast the PWM signal is changing from HIGH to LOW. This does not directly affect the speed of the motor but improves control over the motor speed since the higher the frequency the faster the changes in voltage level of the PWM. The frequency affects the responsiveness of the motor. Therefore, the frequency generated by the Artemis shall be sufficient for the motors. If we manually configure the frequency of the PWM signal to be higher, it is likely to enhance the control of the motor and its responsiveness. Moreover, higher frequencies are less likely to produce noise which is good for the motor operation. Higher frequencies also reduce vibration in motors which allow for better path following by the robot and keep it accurate.</p>

The left motor on my robot didn’t start moving on the vinyl floor until it had a PWM of 30 whereas the right motor didn’t move until a PWM of 40. I increased the PWM for both motors with an interval of 5. However, this PWM was not enough to enable on-axis turns. Infact for on axis turns, friction and other factors like difference in speeds of both motors matter a lot hence, a PWM of 70 on left motor and 80 on the right motor enabled on axis turns of the robot. </p>

Then after a delay of 3000ms I reduced their speeds by an interval of 5 in every iteration. The motors completely stopped moving when I set the PWM values at 15 and 20. They continued to move at the slowest possible speed at a PWM of 25 (left) and 30 (right motor). Anything below that stopped the robot as it failed to overcome the friction and other forces. </p>

For this, I simply initialized the motor drivers, Artemis pins, and the two sensors on different addresses and created commands to start the robot’s movement and send that data through Bluetooth to my laptop. The snippet below shows the initializations. </p>

A little variation is seen since the timestamp at which actual and interpolated values are acquired are different. </p>

Hence the Kp value was set as 150/4000 since Long mode measures upto 4000mm distance from the sensor. I also tested the Kp values of 0.05, 0.07 but the response from at Kp of 0.037 was more suited in terms of responsiveness in front of an object. Following the process for PID control as shown below, we executed integrator and derivative and tuned the suited Ki and Kd values until we found the ideal ones.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">To ensure correct functionality of Integrator, I tested the integrator by keeping the robot at larger distances. The issue that happened as seen from the values was that the error became too large. This is mainly because I summed up all the errors and therefore, the effect of integrator bypassed the proportional controller completely. The robot had a large error accumulated and didn’t stop correctly. For this, I capped the total error to 2000 as shown the the code snippet below. This helped prevent the error sum to be accumulated to large value.</p>
